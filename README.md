## Sprint Review & Retrospective
This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable for the CS 250 final project.

## Reflections

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by engaging with stakeholders, clarifying requirements, and breaking them down into smaller, actionable tasks. User stories help by framing features from the user’s perspective, keeping development focused on delivering value and ensuring testable outcomes.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively, focusing on building small increments of working software. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, backlog refinement, and retrospectives allow me to adapt to change and continuously improve. In future projects, I want to use continuous integration, automated testing, and regular sprint reviews to maintain quality and collaboration.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means contributing to shared goals, communicating openly, and supporting teammates. It includes accountability, adaptability, and a willingness to collaborate and learn. In Agile teams, it also means respecting diverse perspectives and embracing feedback to deliver the best product possible.
